We  are very sad to record here the death of Gregory Pieńkowski on April 19th 2023. 
 
Gregory – Grzegorz – was a hugely valued member of the Jurassic Subcommission in particular and the Jurassic scientific community generally.  He was a man of very wide interests, geologically, culturally and politically, a scientist and a diplomat.  His contributions to Jurassic geology were manifold, ranging through truly integrative work on the Polish Basin, studies of vertebrate and invertebrate trace fossils, sedimentology and stratigraphy of marine and non-marine successions, and economic geology.  Gregory’s scientific work was always broad-ranging, original, insightful and challenging, and more often than not he was proved to be correct.  Sympathetic, worldly, urbane and erudite, he will be greatly missed.

The Jurassic community send their deep condolences at the loss of this wonderful man and scientist to Grzegorz's family.
