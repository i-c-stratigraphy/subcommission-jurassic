#### The 8th Argentinian Jurassic Symposium - March 2023
> The 8th Argentinean Jurassic Symposium (SAJ) is due to take place in March 2023. The SAJ takes place every three years, focusing on different aspects of the Jurassic System and its boundaries. Although it usually congregates Argentinean Jurassic workers, colleagues from other countries are welcome as well.

#### 11th International Congress on the Jurassic System
> The 11th International Congress on the Jurassic System will be held from August 29 to September 2, 2022 in Budapest, Hungary. The organisers are optimistic that 2022 will mark the safe return of in-person meetings and that we will be able to meet in Budapest. The meeting will be held at Danubius Hotel Helia, on the banks of the Danube and close to the heart of the city.
