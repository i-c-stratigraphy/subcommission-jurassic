## Meetings

#### 11th International Congress on the Jurassic System
The 11th International Congress on the Jurassic System will be held from August 29 to September 2, 2022 in Budapest, Hungary. The organisers are optimistic that 2022 will mark the safe return of in-person meetings and that we will be able to meet in Budapest. The meeting will be held at Danubius Hotel Helia, on the banks of the Danube and close to the heart of the city. You can download the first circular for the [Jurassic 2022 meeting](https://jurassic2022.hu/download/jurassic2022.pdf). Full details of the meeting are available on the [Jurassic 2022 conference website](https://jurassic2022.hu/).
