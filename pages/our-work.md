## Our Work
Our work falls into the following:

1. The research of working groups to [define the base of each of the Jurassic stages](#stage-working-groups-and-gssps).
2. Working groups on [other aspects of the Jurassic](#other-working-groups).
3. Facilitating communication on the Jurassic including organization of conference sessions, workshops and the international conference for ISJS that is held every 4 years to facilitate research on the Jurassic
4. Supporting IGCP projects related to the Jurassic.
5. Improving resolution and correlation of the integrated stratigraphy for the Jurassic.
6. Furthering our understanding of the Earth system during the Jurassic.
7. Providing an inclusive and diverse community that facilitates research aspirations at all career stages.

The next ISJS conference will be held in Hungary in 2022. We usually organise a session at the international stratigraphy conference facilitated by ICS (STRATI). The last [STRATI was in July 2019 in Milan](http://www.strati2019.it/).

Research on the Jurassic by the executive of ISJS and voting members of the ISJS can be found under their individual webpages listed on the [members page](members). The journal _[Volumina Jurassica](http://voluminajurassica.org/index.php?p=1)_ is also a good place to find out who else is publishing research on the Jurassic.

### Stage working groups and GSSPs
One of the major aims of the ISJS is to define all the Global Stratotypes, Sections and Points (GSSPs) for the Jurassic. Most of the research work is completed through working groups for each of the stages. This web page provides links to key information on:

1. All the Jurassic boundaries that have been formally defined through the work of ISJS and ratified by the International Commission on Stratigraphy
2. The status of the boundaries that are currently in progress.

* [Tithonian](#tithonian) – not yet formally defined
* [Kimmeridgian](#kimmeridgian) – not yet formally defined
* [Oxfordian](#oxfordian) – not yet formally defined
* [Callovian](#callovian) – not yet formally defined

<div style="height:10px; width:100%; background-color:#8DD8F4; display:block;">&nbsp;</div>
#### Tithonian
A working definition is near the base of the _Hybonoticeras hybonotum_ ammonite zone and lowest occurrence of _Gravesia_ genus, and the base of magnetic polarity chronozone M22An.

Possible candidates GSSPs are at Mt. Crussol or Canjuers (SE France) and Fornazzo (Sicily, S. Italy).

<div style="height:10px; width:100%; background-color:#8DD8F4; display:block;">&nbsp;</div>
#### Kimmeridgian
The working definition of the base of the Kimmeridgian Stage is the base of the the Subboreal _baylei_ ammonite Zone (in particular the base of the _Pictonia flodigarriensis_ horizon, which is also marked by the appearance by the oldest Boreal _Plasmatites_). This horizon, where it occurs in the Staffin Bay section on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, UK, has been agreed by the working group as the candidate GSSP.

The formal proposal for this candidate GSSP was accepted by the voting members of ISJS and is currently with ICS and IUGS.

There is a report of the Kimmeridgian working group ([Wierbowski, 2015](http://voluminajurassica.org/abstracted.php?level=5&ICID=1185698)) and several relevant papers have been published in _Volumina Jurassic_ since then.

The convenor of the Kimmeridgian Working Group is Andrzej Wierzbowski, Faculty of Geology, University of Warsaw, żwirki iWigury Str., 93, 02-089 Warszawa, Poland. Email: andrzej.wierzbowski@uw.edu.pl


<div style="height:10px; width:100%; background-color:#8DD8F4; display:block;">&nbsp;</div>
#### Oxfordian
The working definition is at the base of the ammonite _Cardioceras redcliffense_ Horizon at base of the _Cardioceras scarburgense_ Subzone (_Quenstedtoceras mariae_ Zone).

Candidates locations for the Global Stratotype Section and Point are at Thoux, Provence, SE France ([Pellenard _et al_. 2014](https://vjs.pgi.gov.pl/article/view/26592)) and Redcliff Point, Dorset, SW England ([Melendez & Page (2015)](https://vjs.pgi.gov.pl/article/view/26644).

<div style="height:10px; width:100%; background-color:#8DD8F4; display:block;">&nbsp;</div>
#### Bathonian
The Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Bathonian is defined at the base of limestone bed RB071 in the Ravin du Bès Section, Bas-Auran area, southern Subalpine Chains, France (43° 57′ 38″ N 6° 18′ 55″ E). The base of the stage and Zigzag Zone corresponds to the first occurrence level of _Gonolkites convergens_ Buckman and coincides with the first occurrence of _Morphoceras parvum_ Wetzel.

Full details are published in [Fernandez-Lopez, S.R. 2009.](http://www.episodes.org/index.php/epi/article/view/64041) The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for Base of the Bathonian Stage (Middle Jurassic), Ravin du Bes Section, SE France, _Episodes_, v. 32, p. 222-248.


<div style="height:10px; width:100%; background-color:#8DD8F4; display:block;">&nbsp;</div>
#### Bajocian
The Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Bajocian Stage, formally defined at the base of bed AB11 of the Murtinheira section at Cabo Mondego, Portugal (40° 11′ 57″ N 8° 54′ 15″ W)

The position of the boundary coincides with the first occurrence of the ammonite assemblage characterized by _Hyperhoceras mundum_ and related species (_H. furcatum, Bratinsina aspera, B. elegantula_). The boundary lies just below the nanno-horizon of the entry of _Waunaueria communis_ and _W. fossacincta_, and closely corresponds with a reversal to normal polarity. scale.  An Auxiliary Stratotype Point (ASP) is also selected at the base of bed U10 of the Bearreraig Bay section on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, as the complementary referencefor the palaeobiological key of the Bajocian lower boundary, i.e. the evolutionary transition _Graphoceras–Hyperhoceras_.

Full details are published in [G. Pavia and R. Enay. 1997.](http://www.episodes.org/index.php/epi/article/view/62852) Definition of the Aalenian-Bajocian Stage boundary, _Episodes_ v. 20, p. 16-22.


<div style="height:10px; width:100%; background-color:#8DD8F4; display:block;">&nbsp;</div>
#### Aalenian
The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Aalenian Stage is formally defined at the base of bed FZ107 in the Fuentelsaz section, Castilian Branch of the Iberian Range, Spain (41˚10’15″N 1˚50′ 0″ W). The position of the boundary coincides with the first occurrence of the ammonite assemblage characterized by _Leioceras opalinum_ and _Leioceras lineatum_ and corresponds with a normal polarity interval.

A full account is published in [Cresta et al. (2001)](http://www.episodes.org/index.php/epi/article/view/62651/48862) The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) of the Toarcian-Aalenian Boundary (Lower-Middle Jurassic), _Episodes_, v. 24, p. 166-175.


<div style="height:10px; width:100%; background-color:#8DD8F4; display:block;">&nbsp;</div>
#### Toarcian
The Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of Toarcian Stage is proposed at the base of limestone Bed 15e at Ponta do Trovão, in the Peniche section (39º22’15’’ N, 9º23’07’’ W) (Lusitanian Basin, Portugal) located 80 km north of Lisbon.

The base of the Toarcian Stage is marked by the FO of the ammonite _Dactylioceras (Eodactylites) simplex_. Co-occurring species, which help to define the lower part of the Polymorphum Zone in the absence of _D. (E.) simplex_, include _D. (E.) pseudocommune_ and _D. (E.) polymorphum_. The ammonite association of _D. (Eodactylites)_ ssp. and other species e.g. _Protogrammoceras (Paltarpites) cf. paltum, Lioceratoides aff. balinense and Tiltoniceras aff. capillatum_ is particularly significant for the boundary definition.

The section at Almonacid de la Cuba (Iberian Range, Spain) provides complementary data of the ammonite succession in the Northwest European Hawskerense and Paltum Subzones and magnetostratigraphical data.


<div style="height:10px; width:100%; background-color:#8DD8F4; display:block;">&nbsp;</div>
#### Pleinsbachian
The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Pliensbachian Stage (Lower Jurassic) is at the base of bed 73b of Hesselbo and Jenkyns (1995) in the Wine Haven section, Robin Hood’s Bay, Yorkshire, UK (54° 24′ 23.9″ N 0° 29′ 44.5″ W). This level contains the characteristic ammonite association <em>Bifericeras donovani</em> Dommergues and Meister and <em>Apoderoceras sp.</em>

<div style="height:10px; width:100%; background-color:#8DD8F4; display:block;">&nbsp;</div>
#### Sinemurian
The Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Sinemurian, the second stage of the Lower Jurassic, is exposed in the cliff north of East Quantoxhead, about 6 km east of Watchet, Somerset, England (51° 11′ 27.7″ N  3° 14′ 11.6″ W). The boundary level is 0.90 m above the base of British Geological Survey Bed 145 of coinciding with the first appearance of the genera Vermiceras (<em>V. quantoxense, V. palmeri</em>) and <em>Metophioceras</em> (<em>M. sp. indet.</em> 1).

#### Hettangian and base of the Jurassic
The Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) defining the base of the Jurassic System, Lower Jurassic Epoch, and Hettangian Stage is situated at the Kuhjoch pass, Karwendel Mountains, Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria (47°29’02″N/11°31’50″E). The Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary is exposed at Kuhjoch West and at Kuhjoch East, and corresponds to the first occurrence of the ammonite _Psiloceras spelae tirolicum_.
