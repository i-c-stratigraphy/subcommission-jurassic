#### IGCP 655  Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event: Impact on marine carbon cycle and ecosystem (*18 November 2021*)
> Research from this project was published in late 2021 in [Special Publication 514 of The Geological Society, London](https://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/514/1). Many congratulations to Matias Reolid and his team for bringing this project all of this excellent research.

#### The 11th International Congress on the Jurassic System (*13 September 2021*)
> We are pleased to invite all members of the Jurassic family to Hungary for the next Jurassic Congress. This will take place from August 29 to September 2, 2022 in Budapest. Details of the meeting can be found on the [Meetings](/meetings) page, and at the official Congress [website](https://jurassic2022.hu/). 

#### The Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base Kimmeridgian is announced on the the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) website (*15 March 2021*)
> A brief news article on our latest GSSP has been posted in the news feed of the [International Union of Geological Sciences](https://www.iugs.org/). The main [IUGS Kimmeridgian GSSP article](https://98ca4554-1361-4fb1-a4d8-a1bb16d032e6.filesusr.com/ugd/f1fc07_08ca190c57374ef2bff5a0934205688b.pdf?index=true).

#### Ratification of the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base Kimmeridgian (*17 February 2021*)
> We are delighted to announce that our proposal for the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Base Kimmeridgian has been ratified. The proposal received unanimous support from all the voting members of the International Commission on Stratigraphy ([ICS](https://stratigraphy.org/)). It was then recommended to the International Union of Geological Sciences ([IUGS](https://www.iugs.org/)) Executive Committee who also voted unanimously to ratify the proposal. 

> The GSSP will be placed 1.25 Â± 0.01 m below the base of Bed 36 in the foreshore at Flodigarry, Staffin Bay, Isle of Skye, Scotland, UK. It is marked by the appearance over a short stratigraphic interval of several new ammonite taxa that delineate the base of the Subboreal ammonite Baylei Zone, the base of the Densicostata Subzone marked by the base of the *flodigarriensis* horizon, and, independently, the base of the Boreal ammonite Bauhini Zone.

> Further details are provided under Kimmeridgian on the [Our Work page](/our-work).

> Any enquiries should be sent in the first instance to the ISJS chair Angela.Coe[AT]open.ac.uk

> The convenor of the working group and lead author is Andrzej Wierzbowski, Faculty of Geology, University of Warsaw, Poland. awwierzb[AT]uw.edu.pl

> The Kimmeridgian Working Group are congratulated on their careful and insightful work.

#### Drilling of a new Jurassic core in the UK is successful (*December 2020*)
> A continuous core through the Lower Jurassic sedimentary strata has been recovered this winter from the Cheshire Basin at Prees, UK. The team undertaking this research project is led by Professor Stephen Hesselbo (former ISJS chair). More information about the project can be found at: <https://www.icdp-online.org/projects/world/europe/prees-england/>

#### Defining the GSSPs for the Oxfordian and Kimmeridgian getting close (*November 2020*)
> The proposal for the base Kimmeridgian GSSP has been approved by the ISJS voting members and is now with ICS and IUGS.
A formal proposal for the base of the Oxfordian is likely to be shaped in 2021 after successful workshops in Provence, France 2013 and Dorset, UK in 2014.
