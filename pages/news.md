#### Drilling of a new Jurassic core in the UK is successful
A continuous core through the Lower Jurassic sedimentary strata has been recovered this winter from the Cheshire Basin at Prees, UK. The team undertaking this research project is led by Prof Stephen Hesselbo (former ISJS chair). More information about the project can be found at: <https://www.icdp-online.org/projects/world/europe/prees-england/>

#### Funding for recovery of continuous core through the Lower Jurassic
Five members of the Jurassic subcommission, led by Stephen Hesselbo, have recently been awarded through the [International Continental Drilling Programme](http://www.icdp-online.org/home/) most of the funding to drill a bore hole in mid Wales, UK, to recover what they predict will be a complete succession through the Lower Jurassic in mudrock facies.

#### Defining the GSSPs for the Oxfordian and Kimmeridgian getting close
A formal proposal for the base of the Oxfordian is likely to be shaped in 2016 after successful workshops in Provence, France 2013 and Dorset, UK in 2104.

A 3-day workshop and fieldtrip in Poland in 2015 made further significant advances and established that defining the GSSP for the base of the Kimmeridgian was now achievable. The proposal has been approved by the voting members and is now being prepared for ICS.
