#### 12th International Jurassic congress on the Jurassic System - 29th June to 3rd July 2026 (*26 November 2024*)
> We look forward to welcoming delegates to Exeter University, Exeter, UK from the 29th June to 3rd of July 2026 for our next congress. There will be pre- and post-conference field trips to the main Jurassic sites in the UK and a mid-conference, all delegate, field trip to the Hettangian to Pliensbachian strata at Lyme Regis and Charmouth. Main contact is Stephen Hesselbo, Exeter University. Further information to follow.

#### Sad news: Death of Grzegorz (Gregory) Pieńkowski (*26 April 2023*)
> We record, with great sadness, the sudden death of Grzegorz (Gregory) Pieńkowski on the 19th April 2023. Grzegorz, or Gregory as he often asked us to call him, was a hugely valued member of the Jurassic community and has provided many years of service to ISJS as the vice chair. For more information see: [Grzegorz Pieńkowski](pieńkowski).

#### A great success (*4 September 2022*)
> The 11th International congress on the Jurassic System held in Budapest was a great success. The conference was attended by 103 delgates from 31 countries. Particular highlights were the mega session on the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event that went on for 3 days, the fantastic scientific work being done by the career young members of our community, the fieldtrips, visit to the University collections and conference dinner on the Danube where we also celebrated the 84th birthday of one of our longest standing members. We are all very grateful to Jószef Pálfy and István Fözy for making this such a spectacular and memorable Jurassic family re-union. We missed our Jurassic colleagues that were unable to attend and hope that we might see you at the next congress in 2026. Photographs from the event can be found on the [congress website](https://jurassic2022.hu/). 

#### The 11th International Congress on the Jurassic System - 28th August to 2nd September (*26 August 2022*)
> We look forward to welcoming members of the Jurassic family to Hungary for the 11th International Jurassic Congress, which begins on 28th August in Budapest. Delegates can find information on the congress, including the full programme, at the official [Congress website](https://jurassic2022.hu/).

#### New abstract submission deadline for the 11th International Congress on the Jurassic System (*17 May 2022*)
> The abstract submission deadline for the next Jurassic Congress, to be held from August 29 to September 2 in Budapest, is 15th June. Instructions for preparing abstracts and full details of how to submit can be found on the official [Congress website](https://jurassic2022.hu/).

#### Happy New Year (*4th January 2022*)
>Happy New Year to everyone interested in the Jurassic. We are delighted that the next Jurassic Congress will be held in August/September this year and invite you all to fill in the very short survey on the conference website so that the organisers can estimate the number of delegates attending [Jurassic 2022](https://jurassic2022.hu/).

#### IGCP 655  Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event: Impact on marine carbon cycle and ecosystem (*18 November 2021*)
> Research from this project was published in late 2021 in [Special Publication 514 of The Geological Society, London](https://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/514/1). Many congratulations to Matias Reolid and his team for inspiring and bringing together all of this excellent research.

#### The 11th International Congress on the Jurassic System (*13 September 2021*)
> We are pleased to invite all members of the Jurassic family to Hungary for the next Jurassic Congress. This will take place from August 29 to September 2, 2022 in Budapest. Details of the meeting can be found on the [Meetings](/meetings) page, and at the official [Congress website](https://jurassic2022.hu/).

#### The Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base Kimmeridgian is announced on the the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) website (*15 March 2021*)
> A brief news article on our latest GSSP has been posted in the news feed of the [International Union of Geological Sciences](https://www.iugs.org/). The main [IUGS Kimmeridgian GSSP article](https://98ca4554-1361-4fb1-a4d8-a1bb16d032e6.filesusr.com/ugd/f1fc07_08ca190c57374ef2bff5a0934205688b.pdf?index=true).

#### Ratification of the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base Kimmeridgian (*17 February 2021*)
> We are delighted to announce that our proposal for the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Base Kimmeridgian has been ratified. The proposal received unanimous support from all the voting members of the International Commission on Stratigraphy ([ICS](https://stratigraphy.org/)). It was then recommended to the International Union of Geological Sciences ([IUGS](https://www.iugs.org/)) Executive Committee who also voted unanimously to ratify the proposal. 

> The GSSP will be placed 1.25 ± 0.01 m below the base of Bed 36 in the foreshore at Flodigarry, Staffin Bay, Isle of Skye, Scotland, UK. It is marked by the appearance over a short stratigraphic interval of several new ammonite taxa that delineate the base of the Subboreal ammonite Baylei Zone, the base of the Densicostata Subzone marked by the base of the *flodigarriensis* horizon, and, independently, the base of the Boreal ammonite Bauhini Zone.

> Further details are provided under Kimmeridgian on the [Our Work page](/our-work).

> Any enquiries should be sent in the first instance to the ISJS chair Angela.Coe[AT]open.ac.uk

> The convenor of the working group and lead author is Andrzej Wierzbowski, Faculty of Geology, University of Warsaw, Poland. awwierzb[AT]uw.edu.pl

> The Kimmeridgian Working Group are congratulated on their careful and insightful work.

#### Drilling of a new Jurassic core in the UK is successful (*December 2020*)
> A continuous core through the Lower Jurassic sedimentary strata has been recovered this winter from the Cheshire Basin at Prees, UK. The team undertaking this research project is led by Professor Stephen Hesselbo (former ISJS chair). More information about the project can be found at: <https://www.icdp-online.org/projects/world/europe/prees-england/>

#### Defining the GSSPs for the Oxfordian and Kimmeridgian getting close (*November 2020*)
> The proposal for the base Kimmeridgian GSSP has been approved by the ISJS voting members and is now with ICS and IUGS.
A formal proposal for the base of the Oxfordian is likely to be shaped in 2021 after successful workshops in Provence, France 2013 and Dorset, UK in 2014.
