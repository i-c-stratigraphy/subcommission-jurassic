## About
The International Subcommission on Jurassic Stratigraphy (ISJS) comprises an international group of scientists from universities, geological surveys, research organisations, industry and museums who conduct scientific research on strata of Jurassic age (*c.* 201 â€“ 143 million years ago). In order to advance the global understanding of the Jurassic, we specialise in combining expertise and local Jurassic geological knowledge from across the world in an open and collaborative manner.

We are an official body of the International Commission on Stratigraphy ([ICS](https://stratigraphy.org)) and of the International Union of Geological Sciences ([IUGS](http://www.iugs.org/)). Each year we report to ICS, which in turn reports to IUGS. We have an official membership that comprises four officers (Chair, two Vice-Chairs, Secretary) and twenty additional Voting Members. In addition, we have Corresponding Members. As a worldwide association ISJS welcomes anyone who has a professional or scholarly interest in the geology of the Jurassic.   

The main aims of the ISJS are:

1.	The unambiguous definition, by means of agreed Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSPs), of a hierarchy of chronostratigraphic units that provide the framework for global correlation of the Jurassic. For more information see [Stage working groups and GSSPs](our-work#stage-working-groups-and-gssps).
2.	Provide an inclusive, diverse and supportive international community to facilitate global research and associated activities on Jurassic stratigraphy. 
3.	Advance understanding of the evolution of the Earth system during the Jurassic including palaeogeography, palaeoclimate change, evolution of life, and sea-level change. 
4.	Improve the resolution and correlation of the integrated stratigraphy for the Jurassic.
5.	Facilitate communication on Jurassic stratigraphy for both specialist and non-specialist audiences. This includes sponsoring regular international meetings. Every four years we organise a large international congress covering many aspects of the Jurassic. The next congress (12th ICJS) will be held in 2026 in Exeter, UK.
