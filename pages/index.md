## About
The International Subcommission on Jurassic Stratigraphy (ISJS) comprises an international group of scientists from universities, geological surveys, research organisations, industry and museums who conduct scientific research on strata of Jurassic age (201 – 145 million years ago).

We are an official body of the International Commission on Stratigraphy ([ICS](https://stratigraphy.org)), of which the various Subcommission chairs are voting members) and of the International Union of Geological Sciences ([IUGS](http://www.iugs.org/)). Each year we report to ICS, which reports in turn to IUGS. In this role we have an official membership that comprises four officers (Chair, two Vice-Chairs, Secretary) and twenty Voting Members. In addition, we have an unspecified number of Corresponding Members. As a worldwide association ISJS welcomes anyone who has a professional or scholarly interest in the geology of the Jurassic.

The main aims of the ISJS are:

1. To promote and coordinate long-term international cooperation and establish standards in stratigraphy, with the priority to define global chronostratigraphic units for the Jurassic. For more information see [Stage working groups and GSSPs](/our-work#stage-working-groups-and-gssps).
2. To enable and promote international collaboration in research on the Jurassic and to sponsor regular international meetings. Every four years we organise a large international congress covering many aspects of the Jurassic. The next congress (11th ICJS) will be held in 2022 in Hungary.
