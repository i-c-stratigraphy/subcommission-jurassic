We invite anyone that works on Jurassic rocks to

**The 12th International Jurassic Congress on the Jurassic System** that will be held at Exeter University, Exeter, UK from the 29th June to 3rd of July 2026.

>**Conference venue**: The conference will be held at the [Streatham Campus](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/about/visit/streathamcampus/) of the University of Exeter, close to the centre of the ancient city of Exeter in SW England.

>The venue is easily reached from London.  From Exeter St David's Station it is an approximately 10-minute walk to the Streatham Campus and taxis are available. The average journey time from London Paddington to Exeter is 2 hours 30 minutes. London Heathrow Airport is the most convenient point of arrival by air. Alternative convenient travel from continental Europe is via the Channel Tunnel and the Eurostar rail service.
 
>**Accommodation**: Accommodation will be availale on campus and there is also a wide choice of hotels and hostels in Exeter.
 
>**Costs**: To maximise participation we aim to keep the registration fee affordable. This is is likely to be less than £300.
 
>**Bursaries**: Work has begun on fund raising so that we can offer bursaries through a simple application process for delegates of low economic means, to cover registration and at least part of the travel.
 
>**Conference sessions**: The sessions will run all day on Monday (29th June), Tuesday (30th June) and Thursday (2nd July) and Friday (3rd July). An icebreaker is planned for Sunday 28th.
 
>**Mid-conference field trip**: On Wed 1st July there will be a mid-conference fieldtrip to the Jurassic of the Dorset coast, which is less than one hour’s drive from the conference venue. The cost will be included in the registration fee.

Currently field excursions are planned for the Upper Jurassic of the Dorset coast, the Lower Jurassic of the Somerset and South Wales, the Lower and Middle Jurassic of the Yorkshire coast, the Lower Jurassic of Northern Ireland, and the Jurassic of Scotland.
