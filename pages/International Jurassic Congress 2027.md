>**Conference sessions**: The sessions will run all day across 4 days, wth an icebreaker event also planned.
 
>**Mid-conference field trip**: A mid-conference fieldtrip to the Jurassic of the Dorset coast is planed, which is less than one hour’s drive from the conference venue. The cost will be included in the registration fee.
 
>**Pre and post conference fieldtrips**: These will likely change subject to availability.  Currently field excursions are planned for the Upper Jurassic of the Dorset coast, the Lower Jurassic of the Somerset and South Wales, the Lower and Middle Jurassic of the Yorkshire coast, the Lower Jurassic of Northern Ireland, and the Jurassic of Scotland.
